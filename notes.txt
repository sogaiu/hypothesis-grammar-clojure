# XXX: try to separate out tree-sitter-specific bits from strategies
#      and figure out how to provide them generically.  e.g.
#      any_character_items currently filters out null bytes, but
#      this limitation is specific to tree-sitter

# XXX: expose more knobs to allow testers control
#
#        move parameters to own package (like verify and label?)

# XXX: improve separator support
#
#        before and after delimiters, how to support
#        identify missing locations

# XXX: verify limitations
#
#        no support for #! comments
#        any_character definition is unverified
#        keywords do not handle non-ascii
#        symbols do not handle non-ascii
#        no escape sequences in strings
#        whitespace is limited to ascii -- is non-ascii whitespace legal?
#        parameter-tweaking (e.g. number of digits) unexposed

# XXX: write up some notes on naming.  could cover terms such as:
#
#        marker (meaning things like "#_", "##", etc.)
#        metadatee
#        form
#        non-form (separators?)

# XXX: consider saving generated source strings to feed to a "jailed"
#      clojure process (e.g. in a vm) and log which strings cause
#      parsing issues.
