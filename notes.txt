# XXX: try to separate out tree-sitter-specific bits from strategies
#      and figure out how to provide them generically.  e.g.
#      any_character_items currently filters out null bytes, but
#      this limitation is specific to tree-sitter

# XXX: expose more knobs to allow testers control
#
#        make a list of candidates
#        parameters for strategies
#          keyword - number of characters
#          numbers - number of digits

# XXX: improve separator support
#
#        before and after delimiters, how to support
#        identify (and name / describe?) missing locations
#        discard_* in separators and prepending space work-around
#        namespaced_map between prefix_str and open_delim?
#        between marker and rest of form
#          deref_form
#          eval_form
#          metadata and old_metadata
#          quote_form
#          read_cond
#          read_cond_splicing
#          symbolic_value
#          syntax_quote_form
#          tagged_literal (slightly different from rest -- see code)
#          unquote_form (slightly different from rest -- see code)
#          unquote_splicing_form
#          var_quote_form

# XXX: verify limitations
#
#        no support for #! comments
#        any_character definition is unverified
#        keywords
#          limited to ascii
#        symbols
#          limited to ascii range
#        strings
#          no escape sequences
#          limited to ascii
#        whitespace
#          limited to ascii -- java.lang.Character isWhitespace
#        coll_max must be even atm

# XXX: write up some notes on naming.  could cover terms such as:
#
#        marker (meaning things like "#_", "##", etc.)
#        metadatee
#        form
#        non-form (separators?)

# XXX: consider saving generated source strings to feed to a "jailed"
#      clojure process (e.g. in a vm) and log which strings cause
#      parsing issues.
